Given the global prevalence and potential complications of brucellosis, understanding recent advancements in diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies is crucial for clinicians.Recent literature reveals significant progress in diagnostic methods, including the application of fluorescence polarization immunoassay and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer technologies as well as the invention of artificial Brucella antigens, which offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Advances in molecular diagnostics and serological tests have improved early detection rates, however their interpretation remains challenging. Evolving treatment regimens such as the use of hydroxychloroquine as part of triple therapy and the use of nano-delivery systems in therapies have shown promise, in hopes of reducing relapse rates and managing chronic cases.The findings underscore the necessity for clinicians to adopt a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing brucellosis.

According to the latest prokaryotic taxonomy, the Brucella genus consists of facultative intracellular parasitic Brucella species and extracellular opportunistic or environmental Brucella species. Intracellular Brucella species include classical and nonclassical types, with different species generally exhibiting host preferences. Some classical intracellular Brucella species can cause zoonotic brucellosis, including B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis. Extracellular Brucella species comprise opportunistic or environmental species which belonged formerly to the genus Ochrobactrum and thus nowadays renamed as for example Brucella intermedia or Brucella anthropi, which are the most frequent opportunistic human pathogens within the recently expanded genus Brucella. The cause of the diverse phenotypic characteristics of different Brucella species is still unclear. To further investigate the genetic evolutionary characteristics of the Brucella genus and elucidate the relationship between its genomic composition and prediction of phenotypic traits, we collected the genomic data of Brucella from the NCBI Genome database and conducted a comparative genomics study. We found that classical and nonclassical intracellular Brucella species and extracellular Brucella species exhibited differences in phylogenetic relationships, horizontal gene transfer and distribution patterns of mobile genetic elements, virulence factor genes, and antibiotic resistance genes, showing the close relationship between the genetic variations and prediction of phenotypic traits of different Brucella species. Furthermore, we found significant differences in horizontal gene transfer and the distribution patterns of mobile genetic elements, virulence factor genes, and antibiotic resistance genes between the two chromosomes of Brucella, indicating that the two chromosomes had distinct dynamics and plasticity and played different roles in the survival and evolution of Brucella. These findings provide new directions for exploring the genetic evolutionary characteristics of the Brucella genus and could offer new clues to elucidate the factors influencing the phenotypic diversity of the Brucella genus.Copyright © 2024 Yang, Chai, Wang, Zhang, Zhang, Kang, Liu, Ren, Jin and Yue.'}, {'pmid': '38555491', 'abstract': 'Native vertebral osteomyelitis, also termed spondylodiscitis, is an antibiotic-resistant disease that requires long-term treatment. Without proper treatment, NVO can lead to severe nerve damage or even death. Therefore, it is important to accurately diagnose the cause of NVO, especially in spontaneous cases. Infectious NVO is characterized by the involvement of 2 adjacent vertebrae and intervertebral discs, and common infectious agents include Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella abortus, and fungi. Clinical symptoms are generally nonspecific, and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can prevent irreversible sequelae. Advances in pathologic histologic imaging have led physicians to look more forward to being able to differentiate between tuberculous and septic spinal discitis. Therefore, research in identifying and differentiating the imaging features of these 4 common NVOs is essential. Due to the diagnostic difficulties, clinical and radiologic diagnosis is the mainstay of provisional diagnosis. With the advent of the big data era and the emergence of convolutional neural network algorithms for deep learning, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in orthopedic imaging diagnosis has gradually increased. AI can assist physicians in imaging review, effectively reduce the workload of physicians, and improve diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary to present the latest clinical research on NVO and the outlook for future AI applications.'}, {'pmid': '35194932', 'abstract': 'Diverse chemicals and some physical phenomena recently introduced in nanotechnology have enabled scientists to develop useful devices in the field of food sciences. Concerning such developments, detecting foodborne pathogenic bacteria is now an important issue. These kinds of bacteria species have demonstrated severe health effects after consuming foods and high mortality related to acute cases. The most leading path of intoxication and infection has been through food matrices. Hence, quick recognition of foodborne bacteria agents at low concentrations has been required in current diagnostics. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are one of the urgent and prevalently applied quick recognition methods that have been settled for recognizing diverse types of analytes. Thus, the present review has stressed on latest developments in LFAs-based platforms to detect various foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria, Escherichia coli, Brucella, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum, and Vibrio cholera. Proper prominence has been given on exactly how the labels, detection elements, or procedures have affected recent developments in the evaluation of diverse bacteria using LFAs. Additionally, the modifications in assays specificity and sensitivity consistent with applied food processing techniques have been discussed. Finally, a conclusion has been drawn for highlighting the main challenges confronted through this method and offered a view and insight of thoughts for its further development in the future.© 2022 Institute of Food Technologists®.'}, {'pmid': '33021085', 'abstract': 'Brucellosis in small ruminants caused mainly due to Brucella melitensis is an important zoonotic disease characterized by abortion, retained placenta, infertility, orchitis, epididymitis and rarely arthritis. Small ruminants are the main source of economy for the rural and marginally poor farmers and brucellosis is resulting in huge economic losses due to abortions and infertility and causing public health concern among the small ruminant keepers. Bovine brucellosis control programme has been implemented in India and small ruminants are left out of the programme mainly due to paucity of brucellosis status. The present cross-sectional study based on stratified random sampling was undertaken during 2017-18 to provide the nationwide brucellosis sero-prevalence in small ruminants. A total of 24,056 small ruminant serum samples (sheep samples\\xa0=\\xa08,103 [male-2,440 and female-5,663] and goat samples\\xa0=\\xa015,953 [male-4,331 and female-11,622]) sourced from 27 out of 29 states and two out of seven union territories (UTs), 350 districts of total 640 districts (54.68% of the Indian districts) and from 1,462 villages out of 6,40,867 villages (43.83% of the Indian villages). The serum samples were tested by indirect ELISA and overall brucellosis apparent and true prevalence of 7.45 (95% CI: 7.13-7.79) and 3.79 (95% CI: 3.44-4.17) was recorded. Significantly higher brucellosis sero-prevalence (p\\xa0<\\xa0.0001) was observed in sheep (11.55%) than goats (5.37%). Similarly, brucellosis seropositivity was highly significant in females compared to males in both sheep and goats. Countrywide, greater than 5% brucellosis sero-prevalence in sheep and goats was recorded in 14 and 10 states, respectively, indicating endemicity of the disease. The study provided the latest update on nationwide spatial sero-prevalence of small ruminant brucellosis which will aid government to strengthen regular surveillance and vaccination to reduce the disease burden and public health problems in the country.© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.'}, {'pmid': '28411163', 'abstract': 'Current investigations have demonstrated that a multi-epitope peptide vaccine targeting multiple antigens could be considered as an ideal approach for prevention and treatment of brucellosis. According to the latest findings, the most effective immunogenic antigens of brucella to induce immune responses are included Omp31, BP26, BLS, DnaK and L7-L12. Therefore, in the present study, an in silico approach was used to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine to elicit a desirable immune response against brucellosis. First, five novel T-cell epitopes were selected from Omp31, BP26, BLS, DnaK and L7-L12 proteins using different servers. In addition, helper epitopes selected from Tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFrC) were applied to induce CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses. Selected epitopes were fused together by GPGPG linkers to facilitate the immune processing and epitope presentation. Moreover, cholera toxin B (CTB) was linked to N terminal of vaccine construct as an adjuvant by using EAAAK linker. A multi-epitope vaccine was designed based on predicted epitopes which was 377 amino acid residues in length. Then, the physico-chemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, stability, intrinsic protein disorder, solubility and allergenicity of this multi-epitope vaccine were assessed using immunoinformatics tools and servers. Based on obtained results, a soluble, and non-allergic protein with 40.59kDa molecular weight was constructed. Expasy ProtParam classified this chimeric protein as a stable protein and also 89.8% residues of constructed vaccine were located in favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. Furthermore, this multi-epitope peptide vaccine was able to strongly induce T cell and B-cell mediated immune responses. In conclusion, immunoinformatics analysis indicated that this multi-epitope peptide vaccine can be effectively expressed and potentially be used for prophylactic or therapeutic usages against brucellosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, supporting data and documentation of that experience are lacking. Therefore, typing of Brucella spp. and identification of the most important host species are necessary for the understanding of the main transmission routes and to adopt an effective brucellosis control policy in Kyrgyzstan. Overall, 17 B. melitensis strains from aborted fetuses of sheep and cattle isolated in the province of Naryn were studied. All strains were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, rifampin, ofloxacin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis showed low genetic diversity. Kyrgyz strains seem to be genetically associated with the Eastern Mediterranean group of the Brucella global phylogeny. We identified and confirmed transmission of B. melitensis to cattle and a close genetic relationship between B. melitensis strains isolated from sheep sharing the same pasture.'}]\n",
